Our goal was to create a one-stop-shop travel website.  Usually with travel sites, you have your flight/hotel/rental car in one spot but if you want to look at high quality images or weather information or things to do you need to look at a few different site. We wanted people to be able to search a variety of destinations with high quality photos, weather information, and a map with some information specific to the city.  We also wanted users to have the option to compare previous searches so we added an element where you can click on your previous search and it is reloaded onto the page.

We created the page using html 5, css 3, and javascript/jQuery.  We are using the Cloud Firestore database to store all user searches.  We also used Bootstrap to help with our page layout and MD Bootstrap for our splash page animation.  Our map information is displayed using the teleport widget. We used APIs from Unsplash and Open Weather Map to display the photos and weather data.
